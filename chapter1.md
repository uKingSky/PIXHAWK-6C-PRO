# Overview

The Pixhawk® 6C PRO is the latest update to the successful family of Pixhawk® flight controllers, based on the [Pixhawk® FMUv6C Open Standard](https://github.com/pixhawk/Pixhawk-Standards/blob/master/DS-018 Pixhawk Autopilot v6C Standard.pdf) and [Connector Standard](https://github.com/pixhawk/Pixhawk-Standards/blob/master/DS-009 Pixhawk Connector Standard.pdf). It comes with PX4 Autopilot® pre-installed.

Inside the Pixhawk® 6C PRO , you can find an STMicroelectronics® based STM32H743, paired with sensor technology from Bosch® & InvenSense®, giving you flexibility and reliability for controlling any autonomous vehicle, suitable for both academic and commercial applications.

The Pixhawk® 6C’s H7 microcontroller contain the Arm® Cortex®-M7 core running up to 480 MHz, has 2MB flash memory and 1MB RAM. Thanks to the updated processing power, developers can be more productive and efficient with their development work, allowing for complex algorithms and models.

The FMUv6C PRO open standard includes high-performance, low-noise IMUs on board, designed to be cost effective while having IMU redundancy. A vibration isolation System to filter out high-frequency vibration and reduce noise to ensure accurate readings, allowing vehicles to reach better overall flight performances.

The Pixhawk® 6C is perfect for developers at corporate research labs, startups, academics \(research, professors, students\), and commercial application.
